# WeatherPredict

Multiple ANNs weather prediction with Delhi weather data set created in Google Colab, using Pyhton and Tensorflow.

## Model 1. LSTM
First model utilizes Long Short-Term Memory network to exploit temporal dependencies across sequences of wather data

## Model 2. CNN
Second model uses Convolutional Neural Network to classify weather data. CNNs ability to process multiple sequences simultaneously makes them efficient for handling large datasets, including time series

## Model 3. GRU
Gated Recurrent Unit network is able to capture temporal factors of weather data. It also has a attention mechanism allowing it to find patterns hidden in the dataset

## Model 4. DAY AND YEAR TIME
For the final model (which uses LSTM network), data is preprocessed so that the temporal information is added - this approach leverages repeating weather conditions, which occur periodically during the day or the year.
